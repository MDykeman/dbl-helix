                        <p>The DNA double helix model was relatively simple and has revolutionized the study of biology
                            and
                            genetics. In order for the double helix model to explain the known facts about DNA, the
                            model's
                            chemical structure had to be able to explain three activities:
                            <ol>
                                <li>replicate itself,</li>
                                <li>send instructions to the cell to enable it to manufacture proteins, and </li>
                                <li>change in a controlled manner in order for a species to survive in a changing
                                    environment
                                    (evolve).</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="benefits" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="profile-tab">
                        <p>Once the model was proposed, Watson and Crick and many others now turned to exploring how
                            DNA
                            went
                            about
                            carrying out these three functions.
                            <ol>
                                <li>Replication of the DNA was relatively easy to demonstrate with the double helix.</li>
                                <li>They knew that proteins were the molecules that carried out day-to-day chores of
                                    the
                                    cell.
                                    Thus, they knew that DNA carried the information required to properly construct the
                                    proteins,
                                    and that RNA copied and carried this genetic information to the sight of protein
                                    synthesis.
                                    This is the central dogma of life. </li>
                                <li>The role of mutations and how these mutations are incorporated into the DNA
                                    molecule
                                    and
                                    how
                                    these then affect the evolution, or slow change of the population of organisms over
                                    time,
                                    was
                                    the last function to be breached.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p>The study of these three functions of DNA, sheds light on the fundamentals of the manner in
                            which
                            living
                            organisms maintain life. This is one of the reasons why the discovery of the structure of
                            DNA
                            by
                            Watson, Crick and Wilkins had such a significant effect in the world of molecular biology.
                            This
                            work
                            was important not only to get to the root of the basis of life, but is also needed to give
                            us
                            better
                            drugs to fight off so many diseases, some of which are extremely debilitating and lethal.
                            Without
                            knowledge of the structure of any of the biomolecules, it would be a very difficult task to
                            work on
                            the
                            biochemistry of cellular reactions. Determining the DNA structure paved the way for these
                            kinds
                            of
                            studies. It opened up the door to the world of microbiology, helping us visualize life at a
                            biochemical
                            level, and making us understand better how a cell functions.</p>
